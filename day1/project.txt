1. Github Browser CLI
  - Write a CLI that asks for a github username and then prints various stats in the commandline itself.
  E.g.
  > Githubrr
  > Please enter a github username? prank7
  > Wait . . .! I am fetching info from Github
  > Name                                    ::   Prashant Abhishek
    Followers                               ::   10
    Public Repos                            ::   12
    * You can add more stats here *



==========
Level up
==========
   - Ask for two github usernames and make a small github battle puting their stats side by side


2. Make similar CLIs for Movies, Twitter, dictionary, lyrics etc.
